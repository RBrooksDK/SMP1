<p>Boolean Algebra:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Similar to sets so all rules also apply for sets</li>
 <li>Addition is same as union, multiplication the same as intesection and negation same as complement</li>
 <li>Important: Slide 12 about identities</li>
</ul>
<p>Sets</p>
<ul>
 <li>Basic understanding of sets</li>
 <li>Important: Equivalence slide 29</li>
</ul>
<p>Combinatorics</p>
<ul>
 <li>All rules are important and I assume you know them</li>
 <li>The most used one is combinations on slide 12</li>
 <li>Important: Formulas Slide 12</li>
</ul>
<p>Probability 1 + 2 (2.3&nbsp;= Probability 2 slide 3):</p>
<ul>
 <li>All rules of probability</li>
 <li>Important: Union 1.13, Conditional 2.2, Independence 2.3, Intersection 2.6, Law of Total Probability 2.8, Bayes’ Theorem 2.10, Contingency Table 2.12, Joint Probability 2.14</li>
</ul>
<p>Sequences and Summation:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The important part is Series from slide 19 onwards, not so much sequences (slides 1-18)</li>
 <li>Convergence slide 23</li>
 <li>Closed form formula for series slide 24</li>
 <li>Uselful summations and closed form slide 25</li>
 <li>Changing limits slide 26</li>
</ul>
<p>In Lesson 3, you will need to brush up on integrals.&nbsp;It seems that Khan Academy have some nice tutorials on integrals that you may want to check out&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-7/v/connecting-the-first-and-second-fundamental-theorems-of-calculus">this</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-8b/v/antiderivative-of-x-1">this,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-8c/v/reverse-power-rule-for-definite-integrals">this</a>.</p>
<p>In Lesson 9, you will need a little bit of Linear Algebra. I recommend reading “Matrix Algebra” which is the chapter we use from the Linear Algebra course. If you already passed&nbsp;the Linear Algebra course (i.e. you are on your 7<sup>th</sup> semester), you will probably not need to worry about this prerequisite.</p>
