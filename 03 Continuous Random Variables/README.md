Session from 20/21: [SMP 3](https://youtu.be/KKSraC6Kmsc)
Today you will need to have brushed up on your basic calculus skills as this will not be recapped in depth. It seems that Khan Academy has some nice tutorials on integrals that you may want to check out:

## Topics

Continuous random variables are a type of random variable that can take on an infinite number of values within a given range. The most important elements of continuous random variables are the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, and the expected value. The probability density function provides the probability that a continuous random variable will take on a value within a given range, while the cumulative distribution function gives the probability that the variable will take on a value less than or equal to a given value. The expected value, or mean, of a continuous random variable is calculated by integrating the product of the variable and its probability density function over the entire range of possible values. The most important topics of today are:

- The probability density function
- The cumulative distribution function
- The normal distribution
- The exponential distribution

It is also important that you think about the relationship between the discrete case and the continuous case, and how this transfers to the relationship between sums and integrals.
