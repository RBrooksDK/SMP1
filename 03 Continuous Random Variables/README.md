<hr />
<p>Today you will need to have brushed up on your basic calculus skills as this will not be recapped in depth. It seems that Khan Academy have some nice tutorials on integrals that you may want to check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-7/v/connecting-the-first-and-second-fundamental-theorems-of-calculus" target="_blank">this</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-8b/v/antiderivative-of-x-1" target="_blank">this,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-8c/v/reverse-power-rule-for-definite-integrals" target="_blank">this</a>. The most important topics of today are</p>

<ul>
	<li>The probability density function</li>
	<li>The cumulative distribution function</li>
	<li>The normal distribution</li>
	<li>The exponential distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important that you think about the relationship between the discrete case and the continuous case, and how this transfers to the relationship between sums and integrals.</p>
