## Topics

You will most likely experience that the next 2-3 topics are a bit less complex than the previous three topics.

Point estimation and sampling are important concepts in statistics. Point estimation involves using a statistic, such as the sample mean or proportion, to estimate an unknown population parameter. The goal is to find the value of the statistic that is most likely to be the true value of the parameter. Sampling, on the other hand, involves selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population and using their data to make inferences about the entire population. The key to effective sampling is ensuring that the sample is representative of the population and that the sample size is large enough to accurately estimate the population parameter of interest. Together, point estimation and sampling provide a framework for making accurate and reliable statistical inferences.
