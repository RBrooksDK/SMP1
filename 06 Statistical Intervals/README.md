## Topics

Statistical intervals are a way of expressing the uncertainty associated with a statistical estimate. They provide a range of values within which the true value of a population parameter or a future observation is likely to fall, based on a sample of data. Confidence intervals estimate the value of a population parameter with a measure of uncertainty, while prediction intervals provide a range of values for a future observation, taking into account both the uncertainty associated with estimating the population parameter and the variability associated with predicting individual observations. Statistical intervals are commonly used in various fields to estimate population parameters or future outcomes with a measure of precision and reliability.

- CI for mean
- CI for proportion
- CI for variance
- Tolerance and prediction interval
