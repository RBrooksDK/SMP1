    "# Calculating Metrics in Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Slope (and intercept)\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple linear regression, the slope parameter (often denoted as $\\beta_1$) represents the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y). The slope indicates how much the dependent variable is expected to increase (or decrease) for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. There are several ways to compute this slope, and here are some of the key methods:n\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Least Squares Estimation**:\n",
    "   The most common method for calculating the slope in simple linear regression is the least squares estimation. The formula for the slope ($\\beta_1$) using this method is:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\beta_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})(y_i - \\overline{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the individual sample points, and $\\overline{x}$ and $\\overline{y}$ are the means of the X and Y variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Covariance and Variance Method**:\n",
    "   This is essentially a rearrangement of the least squares formula, emphasizing the use of covariance and variance:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "   \\beta_1 = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\text{Var}(X)}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   where $\\text{Cov}(X, Y)$ is the covariance between X and Y, and $\\text{Var}(X)$ is the variance of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrix Algebra (Using Normal Equation)**:\n",
    "   When dealing with linear regression in matrix terms, the slope can be calculated using the normal equation:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Here, $X$ is the matrix of input features (including a column of ones for the intercept if it's included in the model), and $Y$ is the vector of output values. For simple linear regression, this simplifies to:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\beta_1 = \\frac{n \\sum x_iy_i - \\sum x_i \\sum y_i}{n \\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i)^2}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   where $n$ is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gradient Descent**:\n",
    "   Though not a formula in the traditional sense, gradient descent is an algorithmic approach used to find the minimum of the cost function (typically mean squared error) in regression. The update rule in each iteration for $\\beta_1$ would be:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\beta_1^{(new)} = \\beta_1^{(old)} - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_1} MSE\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   where $\\alpha$ is the learning rate and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_1} MSE$ is the derivative of the mean squared error with respect to $\\beta_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods can be used to explain different aspects of calculating the slope in simple linear regression. In what follows, we will focus on 1+2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Least Squares Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the slope ($\\beta_1$) in simple linear regression through Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) can be expressed in different ways, focusing on various algebraic or conceptual aspects of the calculation.
