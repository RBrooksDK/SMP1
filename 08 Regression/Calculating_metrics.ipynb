    "## The Slope (and intercept)\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple linear regression, the slope parameter (often denoted as $\\beta_1$) represents the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y). The slope indicates how much the dependent variable is expected to increase (or decrease) for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. There are several ways to compute this slope, and here are some of the key methods:\n",

    "### Least Squares Estimation:\n",
    "   The most common method for calculating the slope in simple linear regression is the least squares estimation. The formula for the slope ($\\beta_1$) using this method is:\n",

This term is often denoted $S_{xy}$.\n",

    "- $\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2$ represents the sum of the squares of the deviations of $x$ from its mean. This term is a measure of the total variance in $x$ and helps normalize the covariance in the numerator. This term is often denoted $S_{xy}$.\n",

    "### Gradient Descent:\n",
    "   Though not a formula in the traditional sense, gradient descent is an algorithmic approach used to find the minimum of the cost function (typically mean squared error) in regression. The update rule in each iteration for $\\beta_1$ would be:\n",

    "## Regression Line Intercept Inclusion\n",

    "## Correlation Coefficient ($r$) and Correlation of Determination ($r^2$)\n",
    "This section will present different formulations of $r$ or $r^2$. Depending on the formulation, one or the other is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($r$)\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) measures the linear correlation between two variables, $x$ and $y$. It is defined as the ratio of the covariance of the variables to the product of their standard deviations. Mathematically, it's expressed as:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Coefficient of Determination ($r^2$)\n",
    "The coefficient of determination, known as $r^2$, is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It is calculated simply by squaring $r$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\n",
    "r^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})(y_i - \\overline{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\overline{y})^2}}\\right)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no correlation and 1 indicates perfect correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternate Formulas for $r$ and $r^2$ in the Context of Regression\n",
    "In the context of simple linear regression, where you have calculated the slope ($\\beta_1$) and the intercept ($\\beta_0$), $r$ and $r^2$ can also be calculated directly from the regression output:\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "  where $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the standard deviations of $x$ and $y$, respectively, and $\\beta_1$ is the slope of the regression line. This formula derives from the relationship that the slope of the regression line in standardized units is the correlation coefficient.
