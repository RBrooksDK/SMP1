## Topics

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The key elements of linear regression include the dependent variable, independent variable(s), regression coefficients, intercept, and residual error. The regression coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero. The residual error is the difference between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the regression model. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared residual errors. Linear regression is a widely used method in various fields to make predictions or estimate the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
