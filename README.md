This repository contains resources for the [Stochastic Modelling and Processing](https://en.via.dk/tmh-courses/stochastic-modelling-and-processing) course at VIA University College, Horsens, Denmark.

**Literature:**

ASPE: Montgomery, D.C. & Runger, G.C.. Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers, 7th edition. All references are to chapters or exercises (found in the end of the book). Solutions to all exercises from the book are uploaded. You need to retrieve a copy however you usually retrieve books.

NOTE: The previous exams are NOT representative of the one you will be completing and is used only as exercises since there are some overlaps in terms of the problems.

If/When you find mistakes in the solutions, please notify me so I can update them.

I have compiled and uploaded all session from last year (January 2021) to youtube. The link below will take you to a playlist containing all 10 sessions (theory only):

Under each session plan below you will also find a link to each individual session.
